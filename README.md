## About

A relatively minimalist approach to a portfolio and blog with the intention of leveraging [sakura][8] and the [MDX][5] file format as much as possible.

The first incarnation of this project was created in a more traditional React-centric approach that used `dangerouslySetInnerHtml` to inject Markdown documents into my React components, so this seems like an exciting alternative to that "outdated" approach.
